Part - B
1. PnL: Traders tend to show higher average PnL on Greed days, but with greater variance (larger wins and losses). On Fear days, PnL is lower but more stable.
Win Rate: Win rates are slightly higher on Greed days, suggesting traders take more aggressive positions that pay off more often.
Drawdown Proxy: Deeper drawdowns occur on Greed days, reflecting higher risk exposure.
2. Trade Frequency: Traders increase the number of trades on Greed days, showing more activity when sentiment is positive.
 Leverage: Average leverage is higher on Greed days, indicating riskier positioning.
 Long/Short Bias: Long positions dominate on Greed days, while Fear days show a more balanced or short‑leaning bias.
 Position Sizes: Larger average trade sizes are observed on Greed days.
3. High vs Low Leverage Traders: High‑leverage traders show extreme outcomes (big wins and big losses), while low‑leverage traders remain more consistent.
 Frequent vs Infrequent Traders: Frequent traders react more strongly to sentiment shifts, increasing activity on Greed days. Infrequent traders show little change.
  Consistent vs Inconsistent Winners: Consistent winners maintain positive PnL across both Fear and Greed days. Inconsistent traders swing more dramatically, often losing on Fear days.
4.- Greed days boost average PnL and win rate but increase drawdowns.
- Traders take on more risk (higher leverage, more trades, larger positions) when sentiment is Greedy.
- Segmentation shows risk profiles: high‑leverage and frequent traders are most sensitive to sentiment, while consistent winners remain stable across conditions.
